# Compiler-Project
Compiler Project for my Compiler Design class. The compiler takes Pascal code (I believe with a few exceptions) given to us by my professor, and determines if the code is syntactially correct, and converts the code into expressions to be interpereted. The project was worked on by me and two other classmates over my Fall 2021 semester. The Grammar the language is based on is in the repository for reference.

Run "Parser.java" to run the program, where it will ask you to input txt files of code.
